Choose a program of your choice like addition of two numbers. Write the assembly code in 32-bit and 64-bit assembly languages. Write an interpreter program in any preferred language (C,CPP,Java) which will translate the 32-bit assembly program into 64-bit assembly program.

a.c is a simple program which performs addition of two numbers

File in_32 contains the 32-bit assembly level code for a.c

file.cpp contains the Interpreter code

In the interpreter program, in_32 is the input file
and out_64 is the output file

Compiling interpreter
Executed the interpreter

The output is 64 bit assembly file in out_64


Done !!!
